# 🎮 Serpent Clash — Real-Time Multiplayer Snake Game
**Serpent Clash** is a **fast-paced**, **real-time multiplayer snake game** where players compete to outmaneuver and 
outgrow their rivals in a dynamic online arena. Control your serpent with precision, dodge enemies, and strategically 
cut them off as you slither your way to the top of the leaderboard.

The game is built using Vue.js on the frontend and Golang on the backend, utilizing modern **WebSocket communication** and 
an **authoritative server** model to maintain a fair and synchronized game state. With **server reconciliation** and 
**interpolation**, players experience smooth gameplay and accurate movement.

### 🔑 Key Features
- ⚔️ **Real-Time Multiplayer** with low-latency WebSocket communication
- 🛡️ **Authoritative Server Model** to ensure fairness and consistency
- 🔄 **Server Reconciliation** for accurate game state even under lag
- ✨ **Player Movement Interpolation** for smooth rendering of remote players
- 🐍 **Dynamic Snake Rendering** using multiple coordinates and mouse input
- 🌐 **Efficient Collision Detection** powered by Quad Tree structures
- 🧩 **Entity Component System (ECS)** Architecture for scalable game logic and maintainability

### 🚀 Future Enhancements
- 🍎 **Food Generation & Snake Growth**
  Introduce dynamic elements where snakes grow by consuming food, adding a new layer of strategy and progression.
- 🏆 Leaderboard & UI Enhancements
  Improve the overall player experience with a more interactive UI and detailed leaderboard statistics to showcase 
- top players.
